Why Python?

Every year I consider whether to continue using Python
or whether to move on to a different language—perhaps one
that’s newer to the programming world. But I continue to focus
on Python for many reasons. Python is an incredibly efficient
language: your programs will do more in fewer lines of code than
many other languages would require. Python’s syntax will also
help you write “clean” code. Your code will be easy to read, easy
to debug, and easy to extend and build upon compared to other languages.

People use Python for many purposes: to make games, build web
applications, solve business problems, and develop internal
tools at all kinds of interesting companies. Python is also used
heavily in scientific fields for academic research and applied work.

One of the most important reasons I continue to use Python is because
of the Python community, which includes an incredibly diverse and
welcoming group of people. Community is essential to programmers because
programming isn’t a solitary pursuit. Most of us, even the most
experienced programmers, need to ask advice from others who have already
solved similar problems. Having a well-connected and supportive community
is critical in helping you solve problems, and the Python community is
fully supportive of people like you who are learning Python as your
first programming language.

Python is a great language to learn,
so let’s get started!
